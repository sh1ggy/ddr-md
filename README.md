This is the repo for the mobile application for DDR MD (name pending), a self-improvement platform made solely for DDR & ITG players.

## About
This project is being made to assist with the self-improvement process involved in the pad-stomping games of DDR and ITG before, during and after play. The approach with this project is to not only display chart information in a digestible format to make chart study easier, but also provide tools for you to take personal notes and reflect upon the quirks of your specific playstyle.  

## Stack
- [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/), our chosen mobile development framework. 

## Development
- Set up your Flutter environment as per [Flutter's getting started guide](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install)
- Install the appropriate Flutter [Visual Studio Code extension](https://docs.flutter.dev/tools/vs-code)
- Install the appropriate dependencies with `flutter pub get`
- Either run the project via the debugger or with `flutter run`

## Credits
- This project takes heavy inspiration from the existing [DDR BPM](https://ddrbpm.com/) application, with the data sourced from the process spun up by [xiexingwu](https://github.com/xiexingwu) 
- Credits to the Brisbane DDR community for helping with feedback during development.
