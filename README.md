This is the repo for the mobile application for DDR MD (name pending), a self-improvement platform made solely for DDR & ITG players.

## About
This project is being made to assist with the self-improvement process involved in the pad-stomping games of DDR and ITG before, during and after play. The approach with this project is to not only display chart information in a digestible format to make chart study easier, but also provide tools for you to take personal notes and reflect upon the quirks of your specific playstyle.
